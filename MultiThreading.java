    MULTITHREADING (executing two or more threads simultaneously to maximum utilization of CPU)

        1. Multithreaded applications execute two or more threads run concurrently. Hence, it is also known as Concurrency in Java. Each thread runs parallel to each other. 

        2. Mulitple threads don't allocate separate memory area, hence they save memory. Also, context switching between threads takes less time.
