    Closures are the inline-function valued expressions which means that they are the class functions with bounded variables. Closures can be passed to another function as a parameter. A closure gives us access to the outer function from an inner function.

        A closure is a combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state

        A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function
